## 1. Wiki documents (`wiki/`)

### 1.1. Purpose

Wiki files are **reference documents** — one file per tool or concept. They are linked from task docs whenever a concept or operation is first mentioned.

### 1.2. Naming

- One file per tool/concept: `vs-code.md`, `git.md`, `docker.md`, `python.md`, `shell.md`, etc.
- Use lowercase with hyphens.

### 1.3. Structure of a wiki file

```markdown
# <Tool or Concept Name>

<h2>Table of contents</h2>

- [What is `<tool or concept name>`](#what-is-tool-or-concept-name)
- [Section 2](#section-2)
- ...

## What is `<tool or concept name>`

<1–3 sentences explaining what this tool or concept is and how it is used in this project.>

Docs:

- [Official docs](https://...)

## Section 2

<Explanation and/or step-by-step instructions.>

...
```

### 1.4. Key rules

- Each section is self-contained and linkable (task docs link to `wiki/<file>.md#<section>`).
- Start every wiki file with a `## What is <tool or concept>` section that defines the tool/concept in 1–3 sentences and includes a link to official docs. The heading may use natural phrasing (articles, singular/plural) that differs from the H1 title — e.g., `# Computer Networks` → `## What is a computer network`.
- Provide both explanation and how-to instructions.
- Link to other wiki sections whenever a concept appears for the first time in a section (see [Links and cross-references](./common.md#48-links-and-cross-references)).
- **Connect the dots.** Wiki files are often read in isolation — readers jump in from a task link. Don't just define a concept; situate it. Use cross-links and connecting wording (e.g., `` `X` works together with `Y` to… ``, `` When using `Z`, you will also need… ``) to help readers understand how concepts relate to each other and to the broader system.
- Use `<h2>Table of contents</h2>` (HTML) so the ToC heading itself doesn't appear in the auto-generated ToC.
- When an operation can be done multiple ways, list them as options: "Use any of the following methods:"
- These wiki files must stay in sync with their corresponding source files — variable names, default values, and grouping must match:
  - `wiki/dotenv-docker-secret.md` ↔ `.env.docker.example`
  - `wiki/dotenv-tests-unit-secret.md` ↔ `.env.tests.unit.example`
  - `wiki/dotenv-tests-e2e-secret.md` ↔ `.env.tests.e2e.example`
  - `wiki/pyproject-toml.md` ↔ `pyproject.toml`
- Vendor instructions that aren't good enough anywhere else (e.g., rewrite unclear official docs).
- Provide fallback methods when one method may not work for all students.

### 1.5. Standard wiki topics to include

Depending on the lab, consider creating wiki files for:

- `vs-code.md` — VS Code basics: terminal, Command Palette, editor, extensions, layout.

- `file-formats.md` — JSON, YAML, TOML, Markdown.
- `vm.md` — Virtual machines: creation, access, IP addresses.
- `vm-info.md` — VM base image information and preinstalled programs.
- `vm-hardening.md` — VM security hardening: firewall, fail2ban, SSH configuration.

- `operating-system.md` — OS concepts.
- `computer-networks.md` — Networking basics.
- `architectural-views.md` — PlantUML component, sequence, and deployment diagrams.
- `visualize-architecture.md` — Draw.io, PlantUML, and Mermaid for architecture diagrams.

## 2. `vs-code.md` section structure pattern

Each section in `vs-code.md` should follow this pattern (other wiki files use the simpler "What is" + "Docs:" structure described above):

```markdown
## <Feature Name>

<1-2 sentence explanation.>

Location: see [`Basic Layout`](#basic-layout).

Docs:

- [Official docs link](https://...)

Actions:

- [Action 1](#action-1)
- [Action 2](#action-2)

### Action 1

<Step-by-step instructions.>
```

This provides: what it is, where to find it, official docs, and how to use it.

## 3. Checklist before publishing

**Always required:**

- [ ] `README.md` has: story, learning advice, learning outcomes, task list.
- [ ] Every task file has: Time, Purpose, Context, ToC, Steps, Acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Every terminal command uses the "To…" intention pattern with a `` [run in the `VS Code Terminal`] `` link.
- [ ] Every Command Palette command has a `` [Run using the `Command Palette`] `` link prefix.
- [ ] All cross-references use relative paths and are valid.
- [ ] Wiki docs exist for every tool/concept linked from tasks.
- [ ] Issue templates (`01-task.yml`, `02-bug-report.yml`) are configured.
- [ ] PR template has a checklist.
- [ ] `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` are configured.
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes generated files and secrets for the lab's ecosystem.

- [ ] Compound instructions are split into separate steps.
- [ ] All sentences end with `.`.
- [ ] Options and steps are clearly differentiated.
- [ ] Tool/concept names are wrapped in backticks: `` `VS Code` ``, `` `Git` ``, `` `Docker` ``.

- [ ] Setup instructions cover: fork, clone, install tools, configure environment.
- [ ] Branch protection rules are documented.
- [ ] Partner/collaborator setup is documented.
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTORS.md` exists with placeholder entry.
- [ ] Diagrams use `.drawio.svg` format.
- [ ] `<!-- TODO -->` markers exist for unfinished sections.

**Conditional (include when applicable):**

- [ ] `.env.example` files are provided; `.env.secret` files are gitignored (if the lab uses environment variables).
- [ ] Wiki files are in sync with their corresponding source files — variable names, defaults, and grouping match (if the lab has dotenv or pyproject-toml wiki pages):
  - `wiki/dotenv-docker-secret.md` ↔ `.env.docker.example`
  - `wiki/dotenv-tests-unit-secret.md` ↔ `.env.tests.unit.example`
  - `wiki/dotenv-tests-e2e-secret.md` ↔ `.env.tests.e2e.example`
  - `wiki/pyproject-toml.md` ↔ `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] `.dockerignore` excludes tests, docs, `.git/`, build caches, markdown files (if the lab uses Docker).
- [ ] At least one test intentionally fails for the debugging task (if the lab has a testing/debugging task).
- [ ] Task runner commands are documented in the config file (if the lab uses a task runner).
- [ ] Seed project has three tiers: reference (working), debug (commented out with bugs), implement (placeholder templates) (if the lab uses the seed project pattern).
- [ ] Placeholder templates include `# Reference:` comments mapping new resources to reference counterparts (if the lab uses placeholder-based implementation).
- [ ] All tasks are completable without LLMs.
- [ ] Docker images use an institutional container registry (if the lab uses Docker in an institutional setting).
- [ ] API key or auth mechanism is set via environment variable and encountered naturally during exploration (if the lab includes security).
